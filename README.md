# ASTEC

This package contains the original code of Astec which stands for **Adaptive Segmentation and Tracking of Embryonic Cells**, used to get the results of the two below publications.

This work was originaly published on **bioRxiv** in 2018:

**Contact-dependent cell-cell communications drive morphological invariance during ascidian embryogenesis**, _Léo Guignard, Ulla-Maj Fiuza, Bruno Leggio, Emmanuel Faure, Julien Laussu, Lars Hufnagel, Grégoire Malandain, Christophe Godin, Patrick Lemaire_, bioRxiv 2018; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/238741.

It was later published in **Science** in 2020:

**Contact area–dependent cell communication and the morphological invariance of ascidian embryogenesis**, _Léo Guignard, Ulla-Maj Fiuza, Bruno Leggio, Julien Laussu, Emmanuel Faure, GAËL Michelin, Kilian Biasuz, Lars Hufnagel, Grégoire Malandain, Christophe Godin, Patrick Lemaire_, Science 2020; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar5663.
