\section*{Data organization}
\label{}

It is assumed that there will be one directory per experiment. This
directory contains the acquired data, but will also contain the result
data as depicted below.

\mbox{}
\dirtree{%
.1 /path/to/experiment/.
.2 RAWDATA/.
.3 \ldots.
.2 FUSE/.
.3 \ldots.
.2 SEG/.
.3 \ldots.
.2 POST/.
.3 \ldots .
}
\mbox{}

\texttt{RAWDATA/} is assumed to contain the raw data (ie acquired
images from the MuViSPIM microscope), while the other subdirectories
will contain processing results.
