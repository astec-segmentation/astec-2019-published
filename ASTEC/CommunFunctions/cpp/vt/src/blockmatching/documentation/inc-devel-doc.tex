\section{\texttt{BAL\_PyramidalBlockMatching}}

\texttt{BAL\_PyramidalBlockMatching()}\footnote{\texttt{bal-blockmatching.c}} 
manages the hierarchical/pyramidal registration loop.

As input, it has the two images, $I_{ref}$ and $I_{flo}$, and two
transformations, $T_{left}$ and $T_{init}$. The registration consists
in computing $T_{res}$ such that $I_{flo} \circ T_{left} \circ
T_{res}$ can be superimposed onto $I_{ref}$. The computation of
$T_{res}$ is iterative and $T_{init}$ is the initialization of $T_{res}$


\subsection{Initialization}
\label{sec:devel:doc:trsfs:initialization}
The computation of
$T_{res}$ is iterative, its initial value, say $T$, depends on both
$T_{left}$ and $T_{init}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item if $T_{init}$ is given, $T = T_{init}$
\item else 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $T_{left}$ is given, $T = \mathbf{Id}$
\item $T$ is the translation that superimposes the
centers of the fields of view of the two images $I_{ref}$ and
$I_{flo}$ (computed by \texttt{BAL\_Compute\-ImageToImageTransformation()}\footnote{\texttt{bal-transformation-tools.c}}).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Iterations over pyramid levels}

At each pyramid level $\ell$, images ${}^{(\ell)}I$ are computed with
the resampling transformation $T_{(\ell)} = T_{I \leftarrow
  {}^{(\ell)}I}$. This transformation is computed by
\texttt{BAL\_Compute\-ImageToImageTransformation()}\footnote{\texttt{bal-transformation-tools.c}}
(see also section \ref{sec:frame:resolution}).

A subsampled version of the reference image is computed by
${}^{(\ell)}I_{ref} = I_{ref} \circ T_{(\ell)}$. 
Let $T$ be the current estimation of the transformation, thus for the
level $\ell$, we will compute (with \texttt{BAL\_BlockMatching()}) a transformation with $T \circ
T_{(\ell)}$ as initial estimate. Of course, the returned result will
be composed by $T_{(\ell)}^{(-1)}$ afterwards.

Parameters for \texttt{BAL\_BlockMatching()} are then the subsampled
reference image ${}^{(\ell)}I_{ref} = I_{ref} \circ T_{(\ell)}$, the
floating image $I_{flo}$, the left handed transformation $T_{left}$
and the current estimate of the transformation $T \circ
T_{(\ell)}$ that allows to superimpose $I_{flo}$ onto
${}^{(\ell)}I_{ref}$, $I_{flo}$ being resampled by  
$I_{flo} \circ T_{left} \circ T \circ T_{(\ell)}$.

\section{\texttt{BAL\_BlockMatching}}

\texttt{BAL\_BlockMatching}\footnote{\texttt{bal-blockmatching.c}}
performs the registration for two given images $I_{ref}$ (note that
$I_{ref}$ can be a subsampled version of the original reference image)
and $I_{flo}$ (note that $I_{flo}$ is not subsampled, even if
$I_{ref}$ is), given the two transformations $T_{left}$ and $T^{(0)}$ 
which is the initial value for the transformation.

At each iteration $i$,
\begin{itemize}
\item resample $I_{flo}$ in the same geometry than $I_{ref}$, i.e. compute $I_{flo}^{(i)} = I_{flo} \circ T_{left} \circ T^{(i)}$
\item compute the incremental transformation from $I_{ref}$ to $I_{flo}^{(i)}$,
  i.e. $\delta T^{(i)} = T_{ I_{flo}^{(i)} \leftarrow I_{ref}}$
\item update the transformation $T^{(i+1)} = T^{(i)} \circ \delta T^{(i)}$
\end{itemize}
